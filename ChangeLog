    * OPPPY minor release:
        + OPPPY-0_1_2

    * Current dependencies:
        + Python 3.X
        + numpy
        + scipy
        + matplotlib
        + sphinx (to build documentation)

    * Summary of changes:
        + Fix minor plotting/parsing issues and add multiple dictionary scaling

    * Corrected defects:
        + Fix y_limits
        + fix data append to ignore cycles with empty time dictionaries

    * New Features:
        + It is now possible to scale multiple dictionaries with different scale values


    * Known Defects:
        + Not all plotting features have been tested.
        + Only cycle and time data is ignored when listing plot options
        + Dictionary printing options should be fixed
